# SOLID Principles - Example in Java

# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The single responsibility principle states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility. – Wikipedia

# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The open/closed principle states “software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification”; that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code. – Wikipedia

# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Let O(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then O(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T. – Wikipedia

# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The interface-segregation principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. – Wikipedia

# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. – Wikipedia
